        If a class is having some behavior which is supposed to change frequently, then extract that behavior 
        and made it as interface and provide the implmentation externally, and Pass those interface in the class
        or interface as members. so the actual behavior can be decided at the runtime.
        example : in a store the discount behavior of an items can be changed frequently, or A car engine 
        performance can be change according to the current engine performance.
