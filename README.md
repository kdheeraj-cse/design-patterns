6. Builder

### Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Composite

4. Filter
5. Decorator
6. Facade
7. Flyweight
8. Proxy

### Behavioral Design Pattern
1. Interpreter
2. Chain of Responsibility
3. Iterator
4. #### Strategy :  [code here](https://github.com/kdheeraj-cse/design-patterns/tree/main/src/org/dheeraj/behavioral/strategy) 
        Frequently changing behavior should be code externally and their super implementation must
        be passed as a member variable (Composition), So the behavior can be decided at the runtime
        
5. Visitor
6. Template method/pattern
7. Command
